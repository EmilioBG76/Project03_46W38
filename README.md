# Project03_46W38
This is the third (final) programming project of 46W38 course. The final project 
chosen is WRA based on reanalysis data. 
The project objective is to develop a Python Module for Wind Resource Assessment 
at a specified site using ERA5 reanalysis data. Analyze multi-year hourly wind 
data to estimate key wind energy metrics.

1. My final project have the following structure including required files as shown in 
the following diagram (under construction yet):
